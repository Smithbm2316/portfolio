# To Do for portfolio site

- [ ] `/uses` route
- [ ] reading-time implementation for blog posts
- [ ] "business card" / "linktree" route (`/me`)
- [ ] write a build-time script to pull all heroicons icons down so that we have them locally but
      don't add them to git, since that pack currently doesn't work with astro-icons
- [ ] Add Web Speech API conditionally to page if browser supports it for reading blog posts
  - (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API#speech_synthesis)
- [ ] Add a dedicated page (and link/headline to it on the homepage) with credits for all of the fonts, icons, tools, and such that you use in your site
