title: Array Methods
draft: true
---
After working through Wes Bos' _Beginner Javascript_ course
throughout my winter quarter at UCI this year, I wanted to build a
project to cement my understanding of a few of the higher-order array
methods in Javascript that are very useful: map(), filter(), and
reduce(). I decided to build a small website with a couple of blog-style
tutorial posts aimed at teaching new developers how each of these three
methods worked in Javascript. I also decided that before I jumped into
learning ReactJS, I wanted to build one more site with just plain HTML,
CSS, and Javascript.

In order to accomplish all of these things, I built and hosted a website
on Netlify, integrating a dark mode toggle into a site for the first
time, as well as spending a lot of time theming the project around one
of my favorite visual aesthetics: _Synthwave_ (see Rob Owen's VS Code
theme [Synthwave 84'](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/)
if you haven't heard of synthwave before). I also
took this project as an opportunity to experiment with web components,
specifically Polymer's lit-html and lit-element libraries that make
creating native web components much simpler. It was a fun project and in
the future, I plan to migrate the three blog posts that I wrote for this
project to a more permanent blog site where I can continue to write
about the different tricks and concepts I continue to learn in my web
development journey.
